# PROJECT DISCONTINUED
## WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO FORK THE PROJECT AND DO AS YOU WISH

# Vector
Vector allows the developer to create and extend administration panels for end users in minutes.

## Use now

<pre>
mrt add iron-router
mrt add vector
meteor remove autopublish
meteor remove insecure
meteor --settings settings.json (use the file inside /example)
go to /admin
user: super@user.com, password: super
--> delete content from the body and use iron-router layouts for your main content
</pre>

## Features
- Auto generated admin panel just using settings.json
- Roles and accounts management
- Easy relationships beween collections
- Easy permalinks
- Easy extendable; modules are plain Meteor templates
- Separation between setup and content management; end users are limited to what the developer has set

## Roadmap

- 0.1 (completed) preview mode; fully functional but untested
- 0.2 (current) better core and more modularity
- 0.3 production ready
